### What Is Data Engineering?
* **Data engineering** is the development, implementation, and maintenance of systems and processes that take in raw data and produce high-quality, consistent information that supports downstream use cases, such as analysis and machine learning.
* **Data engineering** is the **intersection** of security, data management, DataOps, data architecture, orchestration, and software engineering.
* A **data engineer** manages the data engineering lifecycle, beginning with getting data from source systems and ending with serving data for use cases, such as analysis or machine learning.

* The data engineering lifecycle shifts the conversation away from technology and toward the data itself and the end goals that it must serve.
* The stages of the data engineering lifecycle are as follows:
    * Generation
    * Storage
    * Ingestion
    * Transformation
    * Serving
* Early Days (1980s-2000s):
    *  Data warehousing emerged with data warehouse engineers building tools for BI and reporting.
    * The rise of the internet created new data challenges for web companies.
* Birth of Modern Data Engineering (2000s):
    * Big data era began with the need to handle massive datasets.
    * Open source tools like Hadoop and cloud platforms like AWS became foundational.
    * Big data engineers focused on managing complex big data frameworks.
* The 2010s: Big Data Engineering Matures
    * Big data became a buzzword, but managing the tools was complex and expensive.
    * Trend shifted towards simplification and abstraction of big data tools.
* The 2020s: Engineering for the Data Lifecycle
    * Focus moved from big data to data engineering for the entire data lifecycle.
    * Data engineers became data lifecycle engineers, managing security, data management, and orchestration.
    * Emphasis shifted from "biggest data" to data quality, governance, and compliance.
* Data engineering and data science are separate but complementary fields.
* Data engineers provide the clean, usable data (upstream) that data scientists analyze and turn into insights (downstream).
* Data engineers build the foundation for data science success by handling data gathering, cleaning, and processing.
