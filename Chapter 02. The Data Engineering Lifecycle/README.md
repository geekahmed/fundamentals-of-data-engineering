### What Is the Data Engineering Lifecycle?
* The data engineering lifecycle has 5 stages: Generation, Storage, Ingestion, Transformation, and Serving data.
* Data is collected, stored, transformed, and finally presented to data users (analysts, scientists, engineers).
* Storage is considered foundational and interacts with all other stages.
* The lifecycle is not always linear and stages can overlap or repeat.
* Underlying principles (security, data management, etc.) are crucial throughout the entire process.
* Data engineering lifecycle is part of the bigger data lifecycle.
* Full data lifecycle follows data throughout its entire existence.
* Data engineering lifecycle focuses on the stages data engineers manage.

> **Understanding Source Systems**

* **What they are:** Systems that produce the raw data used in data engineering (examples: IoT devices, databases, message queues).
* **Key role of Data Engineers:** Understand how source systems function, how they generate data (frequency, format, etc.), and communicate with source system owners to stay informed of potential changes.
* **Challenges:** Data engineers must work with a vast array of different data sources.

**Types of Source Systems**

* **Traditional:** Application servers backed by a database (e.g., relational databases).

</p>

**Evaluating Source Systems: Key Questions**

* **Data Characteristics:** What generates the data (application, IoT devices, etc.)?
* **Persistence:**  Is the data stored long-term or is it temporary?
* **Generation Rate:** How much data is produced and at what frequency?
* **Consistency:** How reliable is the data (nulls, formatting issues, etc.)?
* **Errors:** How frequent are errors?
* **Duplicates/Late Data:** Are there duplicates or delayed data?
* **Schema:**  What's the data structure? Will data need to be joined across systems?
* **Schema Changes:** How are changes handled and communicated?
* **Extraction:** How often should the data be pulled?
* **Stateful Systems:** How are updates provided (snapshots or change data capture)?
* **Data Provider:** Who/what transmits the data? 
* **Performance Impact:** Does reading data affect the source system's performance?
* **Upstream Dependencies:** Are there other systems the source relies on?
* **Data Quality:** Are there checks in place to address late/missing data?

**Additional Notes**

* Data engineers must be aware of the unique aspects and potential limitations of each source system.
* Data schemas (schemaless vs. fixed schema) can evolve and pose challenges for data transformation. 


> **The Importance of Storage in Data Engineering**

* **Storage is fundamental:**  It underpins every stage of the data lifecycle (ingestion, transformation, serving).
* **Complexity:**  Modern architectures often use multiple storage solutions, and storage systems themselves may have complex capabilities.
* **Impactful choice:** Selecting the right storage directly impacts the efficiency and effectiveness of your data pipeline.

**Key Questions for Evaluating Storage Systems**

* **Performance:** Does it match the required read/write speeds and avoid bottlenecks?
* **Scalability:** Can it handle your current and anticipated future data volumes?
* **Compatibility:** Does it work well with your existing architecture? 
* **Data Access:** Can users retrieve data within their required timeframes?
* **Metadata:** Are you capturing metadata to aid in future discoverability and changes?
* **Query Patterns:** Does the storage system support the types of queries you'll need?
* **Schema Type:** Is the storage schema-agnostic, flexible, or strictly enforced?
* **Compliance, Governance:** How does it handle regulatory and data quality requirements?

**Data Temperatures**

* **Hot Data:** Frequently accessed, demands fast retrieval (think real-time user requests)
* **Lukewarm Data:** Accessed less often (weekly or monthly)
* **Cold Data:** Infrequently accessed, typically for archiving or compliance.

**Choosing Storage**

* **No one-size-fits-all:** The best storage solution depends on your specific use cases, data characteristics, and the key considerations listed above.
* **Trade-offs:**  Every storage technology has pros and cons.



> **Data Ingestion: The Essentials**

* **Understand your Source Systems:**  How the source produces data, its reliability, and potential issues are crucial to plan effectively. 
* **Data Destinations:** Consider where the data needs to go after ingestion, as this will dictate formatting, frequency, and storage needs.
* **Data Quality:** Assess if the data needs cleaning or transformation before use. If so, plan those steps.

**Batch vs. Streaming**

* **Batch:** Processes data in chunks, often on a schedule (e.g., daily). Simpler to implement, common for analytics.
* **Streaming:** Real-time or near real-time data processing.  More complex, but allows immediate action on incoming data.
* **Which to choose:**  
    * Does downstream processing truly need *immediate* data? 
    * Is the added complexity of streaming justified by the potential benefits?

**Push vs. Pull**

* **Push:** The source actively sends data to your system.
* **Pull:** Your system queries the source to get data.
* **It's often a mix:** Data may be pushed and pulled at different stages of your pipeline.

**Things to keep in mind:**

* Ingestion is a common bottleneck â€“ plan for reliability and potential source system issues.
* Think about the end-use of the data. Can you reuse ingested data to avoid redundancy?
 

> **Data Transformation: Turning Raw Data into Insights**

* **Purpose:** Transforms raw ingested data into formats ready for analysis, reports, or machine learning. 
* **Key Tasks:**
    * Data Cleaning and type adjustments (strings to numbers, etc.)
    * Normalization and schema changes
    * Aggregation for reporting
    * Feature engineering for ML models

 **Questions to Consider**

* **Value:** Does the transformation add clear business value?
* **Simplicity:** Can the transformation logic be kept simple and isolated for easy maintenance? 
* **Business Logic:** How are you incorporating core business rules into the transformation?

**Batch vs. Streaming Transformation**

* **Batch:** Processes data in chunks, often scheduled. Popular and widely used.
* **Streaming:** Transforms data as it arrives (real-time or near real-time). Gaining popularity for its speed advantage.

**Transformation Best Practices**

* **Transformations aren't limited to one stage:** They can happen during ingestion, storage, or within dedicated pipelines.
* **Data modeling is key:** Applying business logic creates valuable insight for end-users.
* **Feature engineering for ML:**  Close collaboration between data engineers and data scientists is crucial.
