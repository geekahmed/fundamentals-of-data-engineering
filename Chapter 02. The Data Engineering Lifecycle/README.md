# Chapter 02. The Data Engineering Lifecycle
* This book emphasizes data lifecycle management over just focusing on specific data technologies.
* There are more and more data technologies with increasing ease of use.
* Data engineers will need to adapt to this changing landscape by thinking about the entire data lifecycle.
* The book will introduce the "data engineering lifecycle" as a framework and its underlying principles.

### What Is the Data Engineering Lifecycle?
* The data engineering lifecycle has 5 stages: Generation, Storage, Ingestion, Transformation, and Serving data.
* Data is collected, stored, transformed, and finally presented to data users (analysts, scientists, engineers).
* Storage is considered foundational and interacts with all other stages.
* The lifecycle is not always linear and stages can overlap or repeat.
* Underlying principles (security, data management, etc.) are crucial throughout the entire process.
* Data engineering lifecycle is part of the bigger data lifecycle.
* Full data lifecycle follows data throughout its entire existence.
* Data engineering lifecycle focuses on the stages data engineers manage.
